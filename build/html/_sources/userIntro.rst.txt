Code usage
-----------

What can you do within the interface supply to you?

* Set the values of sensors in the robot. It serves as a light led, to turn on a buzzer etc.

* Get the values from sensors in the robot

* Make the robot drive

* Rotate the motor of the robot

Your program in BPjs will include some bEvent that cause those effects. 

All the information you need will be specified later.

Coding programs in RobotBP
---------------------------

In the next tutorials you will learn how to write the code according to the interface you given.

**Where to write?**

The code of the commands you want to send to the robot will be in js file written in BPjs.

In ``samplebpjsproject\HelloWorld.java`` in ``ResourceBProgram("FILE_NAME.js")`` will be the name of the file.

All the commands that you learn in the following tutorials will be written in this js file.
